**Title**: [Plugin] Timestamp - Analog Clocks, Natural Text, and Custom Formats

Hey everyone,

I just released a new open-source plugin: **Timestamp**.

It goes beyond the standard date inserter by offering:
1.  **Analog Clock**: Generates a real-time SVG clock and uploads it to your note. Great for visual daily logging.
2.  **Natural Text**: "It's quarter past five."
3.  **Unix Converter**: Select a raw timestamp and convert it instantly.
4.  **Dev Friendly**: Built using a new modular architecture that bundles standard ESM files into an Amplenote-compatible format.

You can find the installation instructions and source code here: [Timestamp Plugin](https://github.com/krishnakanthb13/anp-01-timestamp)

Let me know what you think!
