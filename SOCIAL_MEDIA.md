🚀 **Big Update: The Timestamp Plugin for Amplenote is now more robust!**

I've just released v0.0.15 of the Timestamp Plugin. We've moved to a heavy-duty Day.js backend, meaning you now have 100% compliance with standard Moment.js formatting tokens.

**What's new in v0.0.15?**
✅ **Robust Digital Formatting**: Full support for `YYYY`, `MMMM`, `Do`, `Z`, and even Week/Day of Year.
✅ **Custom Mitigation Layer**: Fixed common library clashing issues (like `DDD` vs `DD`) with a proprietary pre-pass handler.
✅ **Developer Docs**: Comprehensive new Code Documentation and Design Philosophy guides for those who want to build on top of it.
✅ **Literal Escaping**: Use `[...]` to include fixed text in your dynamic timestamps.

**Title**: [Update] Timestamp Plugin v0.0.15 - Robust Day.js Support & Bug Fixes

Hey everyone, 

Quick update on the **Timestamp Plugin**. Based on some edge-case testing, I've pushed v0.0.15 which significantly improves the core logic:

1.  **True Day.js Integration**: We now support the full spectrum of advanced formatting tokens.
2.  **Custom Token Parser**: Fixed a tricky bug where Day of Year (`DDD`) was colliding with Day of Month (`DD`). I've added a custom pre-pass handler to ensure 100% accuracy.
3.  **Documentation**: Added a detailed Design Philosophy and Code Documentation guide inside the repo for anyone interested in the technical "Why" and "How".

**Title**: [Plugin] Timestamp - Analog Clocks, Natural Text, and Custom Formats

Hey everyone,

I just released a new open-source plugin: **Timestamp**.

It goes beyond the standard date inserter by offering:
1.  **Analog Clock**: Generates a real-time SVG clock and uploads it to your note. Great for visual daily logging.
2.  **Natural Text**: "It's quarter past five."
3.  **Unix Converter**: Select a raw timestamp and convert it instantly.
4.  **Dev Friendly**: Built using a new modular architecture that bundles standard ESM files into an Amplenote-compatible format.

You can find the installation instructions and source code here: [Timestamp Plugin](https://github.com/krishnakanthb13/anp-01-timestamp)

Let me know what you think!
